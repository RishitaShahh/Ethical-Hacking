# Bug Bounty

A **Bug Bounty** is a program where companies reward individuals for finding and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities in their software or systems.

---

## How It Works

1. A company defines the scope and rules of its bug bounty program.
2. Security researchers test the software or systems within the scope.
3. Vulnerabilities are submitted through a platform or direct channel.
4. The company verifies the reported issue.
5. A reward (bounty) is paid based on the severity of the vulnerability.

## Why Companies Offer Bug Bounties

- Improve overall security
- Cost-effective vulnerability discovery
- Engage with the security community

---

## Who Participates?

- **Companies:** Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.
- **Platforms:** HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, etc.
- **Researchers:** Security professionals and ethical hackers

## Benefits for Hackers

- Monetary rewards
- Career growth
- Learning experience
- Community recognition

## Bug Bounty Severity Classification

In bug bounty programs, vulnerabilities are commonly categorized into five severity levels: **P1 to P5**. These help determine how urgent and impactful a reported vulnerability is.

| Severity | Description | Impact | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P1 — Critical** | Easily exploitable vulnerabilities with severe consequences. | Complete system compromise, data loss, or critical business risk. | Requires immediate action. |
| **P2 — High** | Vulnerabilities that can cause major damage. | Unauthorized access, service disruption, or major data exposure. | High priority fix. |
| **P3 — Medium** | Moderately impactful and exploitable vulnerabilities. | Limited data disclosure or access control issues. | Fix in the regular patch cycle. |
| **P4 — Low** | Low-risk issues that require specific conditions. | Minor leaks or usability concerns. | Fix when feasible. |
| **P5 — Informational** | No real security impact; may be non-exploitable or duplicates. | None or purely theoretical. | Often no fix required. |

## Summary of the Key Differences Between Bug Bounty and Penetration Testing

| **Feature** | **Bug Bounty** | **Penetration Testing** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Crowd-sourced vulnerability discovery program with rewards | Formal security assessment by hired professionals |
| **Participants** | Public or selected external researchers (ethical hackers) | Internal teams or third-party security firms |
| **Scope** | Broad, defined by program rules; often includes production systems | Narrow, clearly defined in a contract or agreement |
| **Duration** | Ongoing or long-term | Time-limited (e.g., 1–4 weeks) |
| **Payment Model** | Pay-per-vulnerability (bounties) | Fixed price or hourly rate |
| **Approach** | Diverse methods, attacker-like, unstructured | Methodical, follows frameworks (e.g., OWASP, PTES) |
| **Cost** | Variable; can be cost-effective or unpredictable | Predictable; often higher fixed cost |
| **Use Cases** | Continuous security feedback, catching unknown/edge-case bugs | Compliance, internal validation, formal risk assessments |
| **Compliance Fit** | Not usually accepted for regulatory compliance | Commonly required for standards like PCI-DSS, ISO 27001 |
| **Advantages** | Continuous testing, real-world insights, diverse attacker mindset | Structured, trusted reports, meets compliance requirements |
| **Disadvantages** | Potential for duplicate or low-quality reports, harder to control scope | Expensive, limited frequency, depends on tester expertise |
