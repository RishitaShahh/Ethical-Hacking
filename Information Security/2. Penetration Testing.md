# Penetration Testing (Pentesting)

**Penetration Testing** is a simulated cyberattack on a system, application, or network to test its security posture. It mimics the tactics and tools used by malicious hackers to identify vulnerabilities and assess how far an attacker could go.

The primary goal is to evaluate security by mimicking real-world attacks and uncovering potential weaknesses **before** malicious hackers do.

---

## Objectives of Penetration Testing

- Identify security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
- Test the effectiveness of security controls and defenses.
- Assess the impact of successful attacks.
- Validate security posture and incident response readiness.
- Support compliance with standards (e.g., PCI DSS, ISO 27001).

---

## Pen Testing Process

### 1. Planning & Reconnaissance

- Define scope, goals, and rules of engagement.
- Perform information gathering (e.g., WHOIS, DNS records, IP ranges).

### 2. Scanning

- Use tools to discover live hosts, open ports, and services.
- **Types of Scanning**:
    - Network Scanning
    - Vulnerability Scanning

### 3. Gaining Access (Exploitation)

- Exploit discovered vulnerabilities to gain control or escalate privileges.
- **Examples**: SQL injection, buffer overflow, password cracking.

### 4. Maintaining Access

- Attempt to establish persistence (e.g., backdoors, rootkits) to simulate long-term threat presence.

### 5. Analysis & Reporting

- Document vulnerabilities found, methods used, and sensitive data accessed.
- Provide **remediation recommendations** and **risk ratings**.

### 6. Remediation & Retesting

- Apply patches or configuration changes.
- Retest to ensure issues have been properly resolved.

## Types of Penetration Testing

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Black Box** | Tester has no prior knowledge of the system. |
| **White Box** | Tester has full knowledge, including source code and architecture. |
| **Gray Box** | Partial knowledge is shared with the tester. |
| **External Testing** | Simulates attacks from outside the organization (e.g., internet-facing). |
| **Internal Testing** | Simulates insider attacks from within the network. |
| **Web App Testing** | Focuses on issues like XSS, SQL injection, CSRF. |
| **Wireless Testing** | Assesses Wi-Fi networks for weaknesses. |
| **Social Engineering** | Tests human vulnerabilities (e.g., phishing, pretexting). |

## Benefits of Penetration Testing

- Proactively identifies vulnerabilities before attackers do.
- Helps prioritize remediation based on real-world risk.
- Tests effectiveness of current security measures.
- Supports compliance and regulatory needs.
- Enhances incident response readiness.

## Vulnerability Assessment vs. Penetration Testing

| Feature | Vulnerability Assessment | Penetration Testing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Identify and list vulnerabilities | Actively exploit vulnerabilities |
| **Depth** | Broad and automated | Deep and manual/exploit-based |
| **Risk Verification** | May include false positives | Confirms actual exploitability |
| **Tools** | Mostly automated scanners | Combination of tools and techniques |
| **Skill Level** | Moderate | High (ethical hacking expertise required) |

# Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)

**Penetration Testing** is a simulated cyberattack against a system, application, or network to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities—just like a real attacker would. The goal is to find and fix weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit them.

---

## What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration Testing is the practice of evaluating the security of an IT environment by simulating real-world attacks. It is an **authorized and controlled process** carried out by ethical hackers (penetration testers) to:

- Identify security flaws
- Validate the effectiveness of defenses
- Understand the potential impact of various attack types
- Provide recommendations to mitigate risks

---

## Why is Penetration Testing Important?

- Finds vulnerabilities **proactively** before attackers do
- Helps meet **compliance requirements** (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)
- Validates **security controls** and **patch management**
- Assesses **incident detection** and **response capabilities**
- Enhances **security awareness and training**

---

## What Does Penetration Testing Involve?

A typical penetration test includes the following phases:

1. **Planning & Scoping** – Define objectives, rules of engagement, and scope.
2. **Reconnaissance** – Gather intelligence (both passive and active).
3. **Scanning** – Identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Exploitation** – Attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities.
5. **Post-Exploitation** – Assess impact, escalate privileges, pivot within the network.
6. **Reporting** – Document findings, assess risk, and recommend mitigation steps.

## Types of Penetration Testing

| **Type** | **Focus Area** |
| --- | --- |
| **Network** | Internal and external network infrastructure (routers, firewalls, switches) |
| **Web Application** | Web applications and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi, CSRF) |
| **API** | RESTful and SOAP API security, including authentication and data handling |
| **Mobile Application** | iOS and Android app security (local storage, API calls, permissions) |
| **Desktop Applications** | Security of software installed on endpoint systems |
| **Wireless** | Wi-Fi networks, encryption protocols, rogue access point detection |
| **IoT (Internet of Things)** | Security of smart/embedded devices and their ecosystems |
| **Red Teaming** | Real-world attack simulation across multiple vectors (physical, digital, social) |
| **Cloud** | Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP), misconfigurations, IAM roles |
| **Social Engineering** | Phishing, pretexting, baiting, impersonation tactics |
| **Physical Security** | Physical access to systems, hardware, buildings, and restricted areas |

## Pen Testing Methodologies

- **Black Box** – No internal knowledge; simulates an external attacker.
- **Gray Box** – Partial knowledge (e.g., credentials); simulates a semi-insider.
- **White Box** – Full internal knowledge; used for thorough and deep analysis.
